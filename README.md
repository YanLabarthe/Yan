Welcome to my GitHub profile  

My name is Yan Labarthe. I'm a web developer (mainly typescript / react / node.js) with 2 years of experience that previously worked as a SEO specialist.  

My main working experience was as a web developer for [SCIAM](https://sciam.fr/fr/) for the association [Par Le Monde](https://www.parlemonde.org/).  
  
You can find here some of my work:  
ðŸ”— My website : https://yanlabarthe.com  
ðŸ”— First formation project : https://yanlabarthe.github.io/Project-1-Cinema-MAJE/#nouveaute  
ðŸ”— Third professional project (WIP - for Yalinov) : https://yalinov.bordeaux-1.wilders.dev/  

Sadly, most of what I've done was meant to be used by companies and can't be published for privacy reasons.  
  
I finished my formation at the Wild Code School ("web developer fullstack") where I learned:  

-Typescript  
-React  
-NodeJs (Express)  
-MySQL (request/etc.)  
-How to code and use a RestAPI (CRUD)  
-CSS (Tailwind)  
-Agility (I was SCRUM master of the big, last professional project)  
-Many other things and tools  
  
I'm looking foward to hear from you.  
  
Best regards.
