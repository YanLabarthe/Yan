ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yan.  
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking for work, an "alternance" or an internship  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React / NodeJs / React Native / TypeScript  
ðŸ“ž You can reach me by phone at : +33 6 51 22 53 41  
ðŸ“« Or by email at : yan.labarthe@gmail.com  
  
  
Welcome to my GitHub profile  
  
My name is Yan Labarthe. I worked as a SEO specialist and I'm now a junior web developer (I code mainly in React / NodeJs).  
  
You can find here some of my work:  
ðŸ”— My website : https://yanlabarthe.com  
ðŸ”— First formation project : https://yanlabarthe.github.io/Project-1-Cinema-MAJE/#nouveaute  
ðŸ”— Third professional project (WIP - for Yalinov) : https://yalinov.bordeaux-1.wilders.dev/  

Sadly, most of what I've done was meant to be used by companies and can't be published for privacy reasons.  
  
I finished my formation at the Wild Code School ("web developer fullstack") where I learned:  
  
-React  
-NodeJs (Express)  
-MySQL (request/etc.)  
-How to code and use a RestAPI (CRUD)  
-CSS (Tailwind)  
-Agility (I was SCRUM master of the big, last professional project)  
-Many other things and tools  
  
I'm looking foward to hear from you.  
  
Best regards.
